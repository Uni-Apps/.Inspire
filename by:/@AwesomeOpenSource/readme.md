## [Build a Business on Open Source](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjLkaXQ353210citr52k74DWb3IOzHWL7)
> started this series in order to help those wanting to start a business, get started with as little out of pocket expense as possible, but still using world class tools.  Open Source is some of the most incredible software out there, and far too often overlooked.  I want to expose the world to the value of open source, and encourage those who are thriving in their business to support their favorite open source projects in order to keep them going.
